  <ion-title>Voting in Cambodia</ion-title>
  <ion-infinite-scroll>  
    General elections (Khmer: ការបោះឆ្នោតជ្រើសតាំងតំណាងរាស្ត្រ 
    នីតិកាលទី៥ ឆ្នាំ២០១៣) were held in Cambodia on 28 July 
    2013.[1] The National Election Committee (NEC) announced 
    that some 9.67 million Cambodians were eligible to cast 
    their ballots to elect the 123-seat National Assembly.[2] 
    Voter turnout was reported to be 68.5%, making it the lowest 
    turnout in history.[3] Polling precincts opened 7:00 a.m. 
    and closed at 3:00 p.m. The Cambodian Minister of Information, 
    Khieu Kanharith announced in preliminary results that the 
    Cambodian People's Party won 68 seats and the opposition 
    Cambodia National Rescue Party won all the remaining 55 seats. 
    This election marked the largest seat loss by the Cambodian 
    People's Party to date, and their lowest share of seats since 1998.

    Background

    The previous parliamentary elections in 2008 were won by the 
    Cambodian People's Party, which managed to secure an absolute 
    majority of the seats: 90 out of 123. Despite winning a parliamentary 
    majority, the CPP chose to form a coalition with the royalist FUNCINPEC, 
    which won 2 seats. The opposition Sam Rainsy Party and Human Rights Party 
    won a combined total of 29 seats. In 2012, the two parties merged to form 
    the Cambodian National Rescue Party. However, party leader Sam Rainsy was 
    barred from running as a candidate because he was not registered to vote.
    [4] The voter roll was finalised on 31 December 2012, at which time Rainsy 
    was living abroad after being controversially convicted in 2010 of making 
    changes to a map to suggest the country was losing land to neighbouring 
    Vietnam.[5] Rainsy returned to Cambodia in July 2013 after he received a 
    royal pardon from King Norodom Sihamoni,[5] but Rainsy failed to have his 
    name reinstated on the voter roll and was not eligible for candidacy in 
    the election.[4]

    Since Cambodia had had no official population count for the last five years, the country's 
    population figure is merely guesswork, which has led to incorrect projections of possible 
    voters – making it difficult for the National Election Commission to ascertain the number 
    of actual voters that should be listed in Cambodia's voting rolls. The lack of actual 
    population count could have led to fraudulent voting, such as voters voting in multiple 
    precincts using different names.[7] According to the opposition CNRP, between 1.2 and 1.3 
    million names were omitted from voting rolls.[8]

    Migrant Vietnamese have also allegedly been able to register as voters due to lax identification 
    policies in Cambodia. The opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party played up this anti-Vietnamese 
    rhetoric in campaigning leading up to the election.[9]
